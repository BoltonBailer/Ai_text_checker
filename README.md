# how it works: three ways in detecting if Ai
1. Repetitive and Overly Formal Structure
    AI-generated text often repeats phrases or follows rigid sentence structures.
    It may lack natural flow, overuse transition words, or over-explain simple concepts.
Example:
    "Artificial Intelligence is a revolutionary technology. It has many applications. Artificial Intelligence is used in various industries."
     Human writing would naturally vary sentence structure and avoid redundancy.
2. Lack of Personal Touch or Real-World Knowledge
    AI tends to generate generic statements without genuine opinions, emotions, or experiences.
    AI might provide surface-level answers without deep insight.
Example:
    AI: "Running is a great way to stay fit. It is a common exercise recommended for health."
    Human: "I started running last year, and while it's tough at first, the energy boost afterward makes it worth it!"
3. Logical Inconsistencies or Hallucinations
    AI sometimes hallucinates facts, making bold but inaccurate claims.
    It may contradict itself in long-form text.
Example:
    AI: "Elon Musk founded OpenAI in 2015. OpenAI was created by a group of researchers with no involvement from Elon Musk." (Contradiction)
    AI: "The Eiffel Tower, built in 1987, is the tallest building in New York." (Completely wrong)
